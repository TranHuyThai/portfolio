          <h5>ABOUT TRAN HUY THAI</h5>
          <h3>
          Hey there! Thank you for spending the time reading this page about me. 
          Well, let me share more about myself! I am Tran and currently studying at NYJC. 
          My interests are photography, drawing and designing, as well as the digitalised 
          aspect of todayâ€™s world; coding and machine learning.
          </h3>
          <h3>
          In my secondary school years, I was mainly interested in Art, especially designing 3D sculptures, 
          thus my decision to take up Olevel art. Through my artistic journey, despite honing my design and 
          artistic skillsets, I often reflected on whether committing fully to Art was what I truly 
          wanted. As time went by, my sculptures tended to include bits of technology; Arduino and servo motors etc.
          </h3>
          <h3>
          As my Olevel art journey came to an abrupt end, I was left seeking for a change.  I jumped 
          the gun and chose to study a completely new subject in JC; H2 computing. Ever since the first lesson, 
          computing have always fascinated me, and my interest in the subject have not stopped growing. 
          However, being the unsatisfied me, I often do miss working on art projects, designing and coming up with the final product. 
          Thus when we started learning about web design in class, my interest was undoubtedly piqued.
          </h3>
          <h3>
          One of my wish is for longer days, where there are more time to explore and develop my 
          interests. With the hectic JC schedule, finding time to explore other interests such as 
          machine learning had been tough. However, I believe that if I keep my unsastifactory nature in me, 
          opportunities for me in the future to pursue my interests will definitely open up!
          </h3>
